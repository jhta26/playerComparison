#Player Comparison

player comparison is a tool that lets you compare basketball players' real career statistics.  The app allows you to type in two different names.  When you hit compare, the app pulls up the career and last season games, ppg, rpg, and apg.  It then generates a widget in the middle with information on who has more career games played, ppg, rpg, and apg.
